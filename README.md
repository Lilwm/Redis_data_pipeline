# Redis_data_pipelines
The task is to build a pipeline that can efficiently extract, transform, and load data from CSV files into a Postgres database. The data to be extracted is related to customer call logs, which contain information about the duration, cost,and destination of customer calls. 
The extracted data needs to be transformed to ensure it is in the correct format and structure for storage in the database. The pipeline should also cache
data using Redis to speed up the data extraction and transformation.
